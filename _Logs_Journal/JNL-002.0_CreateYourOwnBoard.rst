Zephyr Out tree Board Porting for RIOC
############################################


when adding a board you need to:

Follow the zephyr Board porting guide

1. Create a directory from your repo or the zephyr repo
   
    .. code-block:: console
       :caption: board creation
       
       # from  <manifest-repo>
       $ mkdir -p ./boards/<ARCH>/<boardName>
       # example: from rioc-embedded repo; $ mkdir -p ./boards/arm/tkriob


2. Under that directory there are some mandatory files:
    
    1. ``Kconfig.board``

        * this will allow your board to be included in the list of options

    2. ``Kconfig.defconfig``

        * board specific values for Kconfig options

    * The first 2 options, allow zephyr to know the board definition. The board name,
      soc family and series of that board.

    3. <boardname>_defconfig, ex ``tkriob_defconfig``

        * A Kconfig fragment that is merged as-is into the final build directory 
          ``.config`` whenever an application is compiled for your board
        
        * In that file you put options like ARM, the board you're building.

            * you list what type of hardware-related software components that
              your board provided (UAART, Serial, Console, GPIO)
