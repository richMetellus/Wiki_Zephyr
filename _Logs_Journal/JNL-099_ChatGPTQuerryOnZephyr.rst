       The Zephyr project is an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) 
       designed for resource-constrained embedded systems and IoT devices. 
       It was initiated by the Linux Foundation in collaboration with several 
       technology companies to provide an open-source, scalable, and secure 
       RTOS for a wide range of hardware platforms. Zephyr is designed to be 
       highly modular and configurable, allowing developers to select only the 
       necessary components for their specific application, reducing code size 
       and memory footprint.

       Zephyr offers a rich set of features including support for multiple 
       architectures, device drivers, networking protocols, and security 
       mechanisms. It is compatible with various development environments 
       and tools, and has a growing community of developers and contributors.
       
       Zephyr is designed to support a wide range of applications, from simple 
       sensors to complex IoT devices. It offers a scalable solution for 
       building embedded systems that require real-time performance, low power 
       consumption, and reliable operation.

Zephyr Project Support for 8-bit MCU?
*****************************************

.. grid:: 2

    .. grid-item-card:: Prompt

       does zephyr project support 8-bit microcontroller?

    .. grid-item-card:: ChatGPT Response
       
       While the Zephyr Project supports a wide range of microcontrollers, it 
       does not support 8-bit microcontrollers. Zephyr is designed to work with 
       32-bit architectures and above, including ARM Cortex-M, ARC, and RISC-V.

       The reason for this is that 8-bit microcontrollers typically have limited 
       resources in terms of memory, processing power, and I/O capabilities, 
       which can make it difficult to run a full-featured RTOS like Zephyr. 
       Instead, 8-bit microcontrollers are often used with simpler, lightweight 
       operating systems or without an operating system at all.       

       That being said, Zephyr may still be useful in certain applications that 
       require a 32-bit processor and can benefit from the features and 
       capabilities provided by Zephyr, such as connectivity, security, 
       and device management.


*********************
Zephyr vs FreeRTOS
*********************

Rich Metellus
Zephyr project or FreeRTOS, which one is best to used for microcontroller with RTOS?

Both Zephyr and FreeRTOS are popular real-time operating systems (RTOS) that 
are suitable for microcontrollers. The choice between them depends on the 
specific requirements of your project, as well as your experience and 
familiarity with each RTOS.

Here are some key differences between Zephyr and FreeRTOS:

Architecture: Zephyr is based on a scalable microkernel architecture, which 
allows for more flexibility in configuring and optimizing the RTOS for specific 
use cases. FreeRTOS is based on a traditional monolithic kernel architecture, 
which may be easier to understand and implement.

Community support: Zephyr is maintained by the Linux Foundation, which provides 
strong community support and development resources. FreeRTOS has a large 
and active user community, but is not directly supported by a formal organization.

Feature set: Zephyr offers a wide range of features and support for a 
variety of hardware platforms and devices, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and USB. 
FreeRTOS is more lightweight and offers a smaller feature set, but can be easily 
extended with third-party libraries and add-ons.

Programming language: Zephyr is primarily written in C and supports other 
languages such as C++ and Python. FreeRTOS is written in C and supports some C++ features.

Overall, both Zephyr and FreeRTOS are suitable choices for microcontroller-
based RTOS projects, and the decision between them depends on the specific 
requirements of your project, as well as your experience and familiarity 
with each RTOS.

Micro-kernel vs Monolithic Kernel
*****************************************************

Rich Metellus

what is the difference between a microkernel and monolithic kernel? Give me 
some examples of each

ChatGPT

A microkernel and a monolithic kernel are two different approaches to 
designing an operating system kernel. The main difference between them 
is the amount of functionality that is included in the kernel itself.

In a microkernel architecture, only the most basic and essential functionality 
is included in the kernel. Other operating system services, such as device 
drivers, file systems, and network protocols, are implemented as user-level 
processes that communicate with the kernel through a well-defined inter-process 
communication (IPC) mechanism. This approach minimizes the amount of code 
running in kernel mode, which can improve security, reliability, and flexibility.

In contrast, a monolithic kernel includes a large amount of operating system 
functionality directly in the kernel itself. This approach simplifies the 
design and implementation of the operating system, but can also make it 
less flexible and more difficult to modify or extend.

Here are some examples of each type of kernel:

Microkernel:

QNX Neutrino
MINIX
L4
Monolithic:

Linux
Windows
macOS
FreeBSD
It's worth noting that some operating systems use a hybrid approach, where 
some functionality is implemented in the kernel and other functionality is 
implemented as user-level processes. This approach combines some of the 
advantages of both microkernel and monolithic designs.

However, developers should consider the learning curve, code size, 
and maturity of the project when making their choice.


****************************
Apache 2.0 License Query
****************************

can apache 2.0 license be relicensed?

The Apache 2.0 license allows the licensee to use, modify, distribute, and 
sublicense the software covered by the license, as long as the terms of the 
license are followed. One of the key features of the Apache 2.0 license is 
that it allows the licensee to combine the licensed software with other software 
that is distributed under a different license, including proprietary licenses.

However, the Apache 2.0 license itself cannot be re-licensed. This means that 
any derivative work or modified version of the software must also be licensed 
under the Apache 2.0 license. The license terms apply to the software covered 
by the license and cannot be changed or modified.

In other words, if you create a derivative work based on a software project 
that is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, you must also license your 
derivative work under the same license terms. You cannot change the license 
terms or relicense the software under a different license.


**************************
Multi App Communication
**************************

Me:

Here is a context: say you have a zephyr based project that have 2 applications 
running on the STM32H7 microcontroller. One application is running CAN and the 
other application have a MQTT stack. What are some ways to make the application 
communicate with one another? And what are practices to recover from an 
application crashing?

ChatGPT:

There are several ways the two applications in the scenario you described can 
communicate with each other:

1. Shared memory: The two applications can communicate through a shared memory 
   region. Each application can read and write data to this shared memory region.

2. Message passing: One application can send messages to the other application 
   using a messaging interface. The messaging interface can be based on any protocol 
   such as MQTT, CoAP, or AMQP.

3. Inter-process communication (IPC): The two applications can communicate through 
   IPC mechanisms such as pipes, sockets, or signals.

4. Direct function calls: The two applications can communicate by making direct 
   function calls to each other. This approach is suitable if the two applications 
   are closely related and share a common codebase.

As for recovering from an application crashing, one approach is to use a 
watchdog timer. A watchdog timer is a hardware timer that is designed to reset 
the system if the software does not respond within a certain amount of time. 
If one application crashes, the watchdog timer can reset the system and bring 
it back to a known state.

Another approach is to implement fault handling and error recovery mechanisms 
within the application. This can include techniques such as error checking, 
exception handling, and recovery procedures. These mechanisms can help the 
application recover from errors and avoid crashes.



*********************************
IPC Support on STM32H7
*********************************

Rich Metellus
Is IPC supported in stm32h7 microcontroller?

Yes, the STM32H7 microcontroller supports IPC (Inter-Process Communication) 
mechanisms through its various communication interfaces such as UART, SPI, I2C, 
CAN, USB, Ethernet, and others. These interfaces can be used for IPC between 
different processes or applications running on the microcontroller.

In addition, there are software libraries and frameworks available for the 
STM32H7 that provide IPC support, such as the FreeRTOS operating system, which 
includes support for inter-task communication and synchronization mechanisms. 
Another option is to use middleware or protocol stacks that implement IPC 
mechanisms, such as the MQTT protocol for message-based communication between 
applications.

Overall, the STM32H7 provides various options for implementing IPC mechanisms 
depending on the requirements of the application.



**********************************************
App crash, reset without Manual Intervention
**********************************************

Rich Metellus
Here is a context: I have an application that is running on  a stm32H7 
microcontroller, not a microprocessor. It has an sd card interface. 
The application crashes when no sd card is inserted. Is there a way to make the 
application recover without having to press the reset button?

Yes, it is possible to implement a recovery mechanism in the application to 
handle the case where no SD card is inserted, without the need for a manual 
reset. One approach is to use a watchdog timer, which is a hardware timer that 
can be used to reset the microcontroller if the software fails to reset it 
periodically.

The watchdog timer can be configured to reset the microcontroller if the 
application crashes or hangs. In addition, the application can periodically 
check the status of the SD card interface, and if no SD card is detected, the 
application can reset the watchdog timer to prevent a system reset. If the 
watchdog timer is not reset within the specified timeout period, it will 
trigger a system reset, which will restart the application.

Another approach is to use a software recovery mechanism, where the application 
is designed to recover from an error state without the need for a system reset. 
This can be achieved by implementing error handling routines that can detect 
the absence of the SD card and take appropriate action, such as displaying an 
error message, logging the error, or retrying the SD card initialization process.

Overall, implementing a recovery mechanism in the application can improve 
its reliability and reduce the need for manual intervention in case of errors.

Software Versioning
************************************


Prompt:

how to create a .h file that use cmake to fill the major, minor, and revision 
for a software version in that format "major.minor.revision"

chatGPT:

To create a .h file that uses CMake to fill the major, minor, and revision for 
a software version in the format "major.minor.revision", you can follow these steps:

1. Define the major, minor, and revision numbers as CMake variables in your 
   CMakeLists.txt file, for example:
    
    .. code-block:: cmake
       
       set(MAJOR_VERSION 1)
       set(MINOR_VERSION 0)
       set(REVISION_VERSION 0)

2. Use the configure_file command in your CMakeLists.txt file to generate 
   a version.h file with the version information, for example:
    
    .. code-block:: cmake
       
       configure_file(
           ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/version.h.in
           ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/version.h
       )

    
    This will copy the ``version.h.in`` file to the build directory and replace 
    any occurrences of ``${MAJOR_VERSION}``, ``${MINOR_VERSION}``, and 
    ``${REVISION_VERSION}`` in the file with their respective values.
       

#. Create a version.h.in file in your source directory with the following contents:
    
    .. code-block:: c
       
       #ifndef VERSION_H
       #define VERSION_H
       
       #define VERSION_MAJOR ${MAJOR_VERSION}
       #define VERSION_MINOR ${MINOR_VERSION}
       #define VERSION_REVISION ${REVISION_VERSION}
       
       #define VERSION_STRING "${MAJOR_VERSION}.${MINOR_VERSION}.${REVISION_VERSION}"
       
       #endif // VERSION_H
    
    This file contains preprocessor macros for the version numbers and a 
    string representation of the version in the desired format.

#. Include the generated version.h file in your source code as needed, for example:
    

    .. code-block:: c
       
       #include "version.h"
       ...
       printf("Software version: %s\n", VERSION_STRING);
    
    With these steps, you should be able to create a version.h file that 
    contains the major, minor, and revision numbers in the desired format, and 
    can be included in your software application to display the software version.

chatGPT:

This is a header file called "app_version.h" that defines some macros related 
to the version of an application. Here are some key parts of the code:

* The header guards: These lines ensure that the contents of the header file are 
  only included once in a compilation unit. If the header has already been 
  included, the preprocessor skips over the code inside the 
  ``#ifndef APP_VERSION_H_`` and ``#endif`` lines.

* Macro definitions: The code defines several macros related to the application 
  version. Specifically, it defines ``APP_VERSION_MAJOR``, ``APP_VERSION_MINOR``, 
  and ``APP_VERSION_PATCH``, which are integers representing the major, minor, 
  and patch versions of the application, respectively. 
  It also defines APP_VERSION, which is a 32-bit integer representation of the 
  version (constructed by bit-shifting the major, minor, and patch values), and 
  ``APP_VERSION_STR``, which is a string representation of the version.

* The macro values: The macro values are defined using CMake variables, which 
  are denoted by the ${...} syntax. Specifically, ``${PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR}``, 
  ``${PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR}``, and ``${PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH}`` 
  are defined in the CMakeLists.txt file for the project, 
  and they are substituted into the header file during the build process.

* The copyright/license notice: These lines indicate the copyright holder 
  and license for the code.

  Overall, this header file provides a convenient way to define and access 
  the version of an application in a consistent manner.

   ```  

**chatGPT3.5**

.. compound::

   This code defines macros for an application version in the format 
   "Major.Minor.Patch" and calculates a version value based on these components.
    Let's go through the code step by step:

   1. `APP_VERSION_MAJOR`, `APP_VERSION_MINOR`, and `APP_VERSION_PATCH` are 
   macros that define the major, minor, and patch components of the application version.
   
   2. `APP_VERSION` is a macro that calculates a version value by combining the 
   major, minor, and patch components using bitwise shifts and addition.
   
      - `(APP_VERSION_MAJOR << 16)` shifts the value of `APP_VERSION_MAJOR` left 
      by 16 bits, placing its bits in the most significant 16 bits of the version value.
      - `(APP_VERSION_MINOR << 8)` shifts the value of `APP_VERSION_MINOR` 
      left by 8 bits, placing its bits in the next 8 bits.
      - `APP_VERSION_PATCH` keeps its value as-is and places it in the least 
      significant 8 bits.
   
   3. The combined result of these shifts and additions is the calculated 
   application version value. This value is a 32-bit integer where the major 
   version occupies the upper 16 bits, the minor version occupies the middle 
   8 bits, and the patch version occupies the lowest 8 bits.
   
   So, for the given version components:
   
   - `APP_VERSION_MAJOR` is `1`, which in binary is `00000000 00000000 00000001`
   - `APP_VERSION_MINOR` is `2`, which in binary is `00000000 00000000 00000010`
   - `APP_VERSION_PATCH` is `3`, which in binary is `00000000 00000000 00000011`
   
   The calculated `APP_VERSION` will be:
   
   ```
   00000000 00000001 00000010 00000011
         1        1        2        3
   ```
   
   In decimal, this is `66051`.
   
   This version format is common in software development for representing version 
   information numerically. The individual components can help convey the 
   significance of the changes made in different versions of the application.
   


   
*****************************************
How Does Zephyr Talk to hardware?
*****************************************

Prompt:

How does the zephyr rtos talk to hardware?

chatGPT:

Zephyr RTOS uses device drivers to talk to hardware. Device drivers are a set 
of software routines that abstract hardware-specific details and provide a 
standardized interface for interacting with hardware devices. Zephyr RTOS comes 
with a large set of device drivers that are written in a way to provide 
portability across different hardware platforms.

Zephyr device drivers are typically written to conform to a standard interface 
defined by the Zephyr project, which allows the drivers to be easily ported to 
other hardware platforms. The Zephyr device driver interface provides a set of 
common functions for device initialization, device configuration, and data 
transfer between the device and the application.

In addition to device drivers, Zephyr RTOS also provides hardware abstraction 
layers (HALs) that help to abstract the hardware-specific details of the device 
drivers from the rest of the system. The HAL provides a set of common functions 
that can be used by device drivers to interact with the hardware, such as GPIO, 
I2C, SPI, UART, and more.

By using device drivers and HALs, Zephyr RTOS can talk to hardware in a way 
that is independent of the underlying hardware platform, allowing applications 
to be easily ported between different hardware platforms.


**********************
Status LED Defines
**********************

Prompt:

Pretend you are a developer using zephyr project to create a firmware. You are 
building the board support package for stm32h723. You create a file located at 
bsp/led/led_hw_defines.h .  In that file you want to define the pins for leds 
that will take the alias from the device tree. How will you defines 3 pins named 
LED_POWER, LED_COM, LED_ERR?

chatGPT:

To define the pins for the ``LED_POWER``, ``LED_COM``, and ``LED_ERR`` aliases in the 
``led_hw_defines.h`` file for the stm32h723 BSP in Zephyr, we can use the 
following code:

.. code-block:: c

   #ifndef _LED_HW_DEFINES_H_
   #define _LED_HW_DEFINES_H_
   
   #ifdef __cplusplus
   extern "C" {
   #endif
   
   #define LED_POWER_NODE DT_ALIAS(led_power)
   #define LED_COM_NODE DT_ALIAS(led_com)
   #define LED_ERR_NODE DT_ALIAS(led_err)
   
   #define LED_POWER_PIN  DT_GPIO_PIN(LED_POWER_NODE, gpios)
   #define LED_POWER_PORT DT_GPIO_LABEL(LED_POWER_NODE, gpios)
   
   #define LED_COM_PIN  DT_GPIO_PIN(LED_COM_NODE, gpios)
   #define LED_COM_PORT DT_GPIO_LABEL(LED_COM_NODE, gpios)
   
   #define LED_ERR_PIN  DT_GPIO_PIN(LED_ERR_NODE, gpios)
   #define LED_ERR_PORT DT_GPIO_LABEL(LED_ERR_NODE, gpios)
   
   #ifdef __cplusplus
   }
   #endif
   
   #endif /* _LED_HW_DEFINES_H_ */
   
In this code, we first check if the header file has already been defined to 
avoid double inclusion. Then, we include the necessary headers and define the 
aliases for each LED using DT_ALIAS. Next, we define the pins and ports for 
each LED using DT_GPIO_PIN and DT_GPIO_LABEL with the corresponding aliases. 
Finally, we wrap the definitions in extern "C" if we are using a C++ compiler 
and end the file with the header file guard.

Prompt:

continuing from my previous question... Now build a CMakelists.txt in a way that 
whenever the developer wants to include the led_hw_defines.h file in a particular 
code section, they include it that way <include/bsp/led_defines.h>

chatGPT:

Assuming that the led_hw_defines.h file is located in the bsp/led directory, 
the following CMakeLists.txt file can be used to include it in a particular 

.. code-block:: c


    # Add include directory
    target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC
        $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include>
        $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/bsp/led>
        $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include>
    )
    
    # Add source files
    target_sources(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE
        <path_to_your_source_file>.c
        <path_to_your_source_file>.h
        bsp/led/led_hw_defines.h
    )

This CMakeLists.txt file includes the bsp/led directory in the include search 
path and adds the led_hw_defines.h file to the source files for a particular 
code section. The developer can then include the led_hw_defines.h file in their 
code using the following directive:

.. code-block:: c
   
   #include <bsp/led/led_hw_defines.h>

This will include the led_hw_defines.h file from the bsp/led directory.

Prompt:

given the following line from a device tree, 
`reset-gpio = <&gpio2 14 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;` what is GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH?

chatGPT:

GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH is a constant defined in the device tree bindings for GPIO, 
which indicates the default polarity of the GPIO signal. In this case, it 
means that when the GPIO pin is set to the "active" state (i.e., a 
logical high level), the signal is driven high.

Prompt:

I am still confuse abut ACTIVE_HIGH and ACTIVE_LOW. Can you explain it to me 
like i'm a 5 year old


chatGPT:

Sure, I can explain it in a way that is easy to understand!

Think about a light switch in your house. When you turn the switch ON, the 
light turns ON. This is like ACTIVE_HIGH - when you send a signal to turn 
something ON, the signal is sent with a high voltage level.

Now, imagine you have a toy car with a remote control. When you press the 
button to make the car go forward, the car moves forward. But what if you want 
the car to move when you're not pressing the button? Then you need to make the 
button work in the opposite way - when you're not pressing it, the car moves.
This is like ACTIVE_LOW - when you send a signal to turn something ON, the 
signal is sent with a low voltage level.

So, to summarize: ACTIVE_HIGH means turning something ON with a high voltage 
signal, like turning ON a light switch. ACTIVE_LOW means turning something ON 
with a low voltage signal, like pressing a button on a remote control.

Define an array of gpio_dt_spec
*********************************


Prompt: 

Can you define a array of static const struct gpio_dt_spec?

ChatGPT:

Certainly! Here's an example of how you can define an array of static const struct gpio_dt_spec:

.. code-block:: c

   static const struct gpio_dt_spec led_specs[] = {
       GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET(LED_POWER_NODE, gpios),
       GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET(LED_COM_NODE, gpios),
       GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET(LED_ERR_NODE, gpios),
   };

In this example, an array named ``led_specs`` is defined, which contains elements of 
type ``struct gpio_dt_spec``. Each element in the array is initialized using 
the ``GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET`` macro, similar to the previous example.

You can add as many elements as needed to the led_specs array, depending on 
the number of GPIO pins you want to configure using the device tree. Just make 
sure to define the appropriate device tree node identifiers and GPIO controller 
array pointer for each element.

Note that the array is declared as static const, which means it is a constant 
array and its contents cannot be modified at runtime. **The static keyword ensures 
that the array is only visible within the current source file and has a static 
lifetime.**

Read Input Using Zephyr     
***********************************


Prompt: How do you use zephyr to read a digital input pin?

ChatGPT:


To read a digital input pin using Zephyr, you can follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary Zephyr headers:

    .. code-block:: c
       
       #include <device.h>
       #include <drivers/gpio.h>

#. Get the device binding for the specific GPIO pin:
    
    .. code-block:: c
       
       const struct device *gpio_dev;
       gpio_dev = device_get_binding("your_gpio_alias");
       if (!gpio_dev) {
           printk("Failed to get GPIO device binding\n");
           return;
       }
   
   Replace "your_gpio_alias" with the appropriate devicetree alias for your GPIO pin.

#. Configure the GPIO pin as an input: ``gpio_pin_configure(gpio_dev, your_pin_number, GPIO_INPUT);``
   Replace your_pin_number with the actual pin number of the GPIO pin you want to read.

#. Read the state of the GPIO pin:
    
    .. code-block:: c
        
        int pin_state;
        gpio_pin_read(gpio_dev, your_pin_number, &pin_state);

    The pin_state variable will contain the current state of the GPIO pin (0 for low, 1 for high).

    Here's an example of a complete function that reads a digital input pin using Zephyr:

    .. code-block:: c
       
       #include <device.h>
       #include <drivers/gpio.h>
       
       void read_input_pin(void)
       {
           const struct device *gpio_dev;
           int pin_state;
       
           gpio_dev = device_get_binding("your_gpio_alias");
           if (!gpio_dev) {
               printk("Failed to get GPIO device binding\n");
               return;
           }
       
           gpio_pin_configure(gpio_dev, your_pin_number, GPIO_INPUT);
       
           gpio_pin_read(gpio_dev, your_pin_number, &pin_state);
           printk("Pin state: %d\n", pin_state);
       }
    
    Remember to replace "your_gpio_alias" with the appropriate devicetree alias 
    and your_pin_number with the actual pin number you want to read.

Prompt:

There is not gpio_pin_read in zephyr project

ChatGPT:

Apologies for the incorrect information. You are right, Zephyr does not provide 
a specific gpio_pin_read function. Instead, you can use the gpio_pin_get function 
to read the state of a digital input pin. Here's an updated example:

    .. code-block:: c

       #include <device.h>
       #include <drivers/gpio.h>
       
       void read_input_pin(void)
       {
           const struct device *gpio_dev;
           int pin_state;
       
           gpio_dev = device_get_binding("your_gpio_alias");
           if (!gpio_dev) {
               printk("Failed to get GPIO device binding\n");
               return;
           }
       
           gpio_pin_configure(gpio_dev, your_pin_number, GPIO_INPUT);
       
           if (gpio_pin_get(gpio_dev, your_pin_number) > 0) {
               printk("Pin is high\n");
           } else {
               printk("Pin is low\n");
           }
       }

What are PWM and How to Generate one in Zephyr Project
********************************************************

Query:

what are some ways to accomplish  pulse width modulation of a signal? what type 
of PWM exists and can you give an example using the zephyr project?


ChatGPT:

       
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to generate analog-like signals 
by varying the duty cycle of a digital signal. It is commonly used in applications 
such as controlling motor speed, LED brightness, and audio synthesis. There are 
several ways to accomplish PWM:

1. Software-based PWM: This method involves manually toggling a GPIO pin at a 
   specific frequency and controlling the duty cycle by adjusting the time the pin 
   stays high or low. This approach can be used when hardware PWM is not available, 
   but it may introduce timing inaccuracies and is generally less efficient.

2. Hardware-based PWM: Many microcontrollers and SoCs have dedicated hardware 
   peripherals for generating PWM signals. These peripherals provide accurate 
   and efficient PWM generation, often with additional features like configurable 
   frequency and resolution. Hardware-based PWM is typically preferred for 
   precise control and high-performance applications.

In the Zephyr Project, you can use the `pwm` API to control PWM signals. The 
exact implementation depends on the specific hardware platform and driver 
you are using. Here's a simplified example of how to use PWM in Zephyr:

.. code-block:: c

    #include <device.h>
    #include <drivers/pwm.h>
    
    void pwm_example(void)
    {
        const struct device *pwm_dev;
        struct pwm_config pwm_cfg = {
            .pulse_width = 500,          // Set initial pulse width (in nanoseconds)
            .period = 2000,              // Set PWM period (in nanoseconds)
            .flags = PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL // Set PWM polarity (normal or inverted)
        };
    
        pwm_dev = device_get_binding("your_pwm_alias");
        if (!pwm_dev) {
            printk("Failed to get PWM device binding\n");
            return;
        }
    
        int ret = pwm_pin_set_usec(pwm_dev, your_pin_number, 0, pwm_cfg.pulse_width);
        if (ret < 0) {
            printk("Failed to set PWM pulse width\n");
            return;
        }
    
        ret = pwm_pin_set_cycles(pwm_dev, your_pin_number, pwm_cfg.period, pwm_cfg.pulse_width);
        if (ret < 0) {
            printk("Failed to set PWM period\n");
            return;
        }
    
        ret = pwm_pin_set_polarity(pwm_dev, your_pin_number, pwm_cfg.flags);
        if (ret < 0) {
            printk("Failed to set PWM polarity\n");
            return;
        }
    
        ret = pwm_pin_enable(pwm_dev, your_pin_number);
        if (ret < 0) {
            printk("Failed to enable PWM pin\n");
            return;
        }
    
        // Now the PWM signal is generated on the specified pin with the configured settings
    }
    

In this example, you need to replace ``"your_pwm_alias"`` with the appropriate 
devicetree alias for the PWM controller and ``your_pin_number`` with the actual 
pin number you want to generate PWM on. The ``pulse_width`` and ``period`` values 
determine the duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signal, respectively. 
The ``flags`` field can be used to configure the polarity of the signal 
(normal or inverted).
